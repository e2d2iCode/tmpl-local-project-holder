## Overview

This folder hosts the administrative information about the held projects. While its core organization
shouldn't be modified from one project to another, the internal structure of its subfolders is likely to
be adapted to the specificities of the project at hand. In particular, in the case when the project
consists of multiple subprojects, subfolders like `audits` and `todo&notes` should be partionned
according to the relationships between those subprojects and their natural grouping by topic ot type.

This folder is not meant to be a versioned repository, but rather a local folder structure that will
itself contain one or more repositories. Note that it is not to be confused with a mono-repo either
since its root folders are not meant to be versioned. The contents of the `workspace(s)` folder,
however, *may* be versioned by itself or contain multiple subfolders, each of which being a
mono-repo, a multi-repo or a simple folder.

## Description

@@POJECT_DESCRIPTION@@

## Folders Hierarchy

Each folder of the template that was used to instantiate this project contains a `.gitkeep` file
containing a description of its purpose. In addition, the folder `resources/manuals` contain several
documents describing in more detail certain aspects of the template and its usage, and suggesting
some best practices and conventions.

As a quick overview, and a reference of the template's structure once the unnecessary files and
folders have been removed, the following tree shows the structure of the template:

<div style="min-width: 45em; font-size: normal; margin: 0 10% 5ex 5%;">

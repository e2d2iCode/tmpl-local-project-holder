## Overview

This template provides a folder hierarchy for holding one or more projects sharing common
resources.  Its versatile structure is suitable for all sorts of projects, regardless of their size,
complexity, or nature. It is not meant to be used as a repository template, but rather as a template
for a local folder structure that will itself contain one or more repositories. Note that it is not to be
confused with a mono-repo either since its root folders are not meant to be versioned. The
contents of the `workspace(s)` folder, however, *may* be versioned by itself or contain multiple
subfolders, each of which being a mono-repo, a multi-repo or a simple folder.

### The *workspaces* folder

The `workspaces` folder is the environment where development happens. It contains all the material
needed to develop, test, and build the project. Depending on the project's nature, it may consist
of one or more sub-folders, each containing a different workspace that may or may not be related to
the others besides being part of the same project's folder hierarchy.<br/>

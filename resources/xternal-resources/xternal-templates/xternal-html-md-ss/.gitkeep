# External Html/Markdown/Stylesheet Templates

!!!Abstract
    This folder holds external **`Html / Markdown / Stylesheet`**  templates, which are templates that not maintained by the project's team, but externally, whether by a third party or by the user himself but in a different project. The files in this folder are meant to be linked to from the [`html-md-ss folder/`](../../html-md-ss) located at the root of the project's [`resources` environment](../../.gitkeep). For detailed information about this type of resources, please refer to that folder's  [`.gitkeep` file](../../../templates/html-md-ss/.gitkeep).

## Overview

This folder contains templates of *Html*, *Markdown* and *Stylesheet* documents that are not maintained by the project's team, but externally, whether by a third party or by the user himself but in a different project. The files in this folder are meant to be linked to from other locations in the project's [`resources` environment](../../.gitkeep) based on their type and purpose.

## The *style.less* file

The [`./style.less` file](./stle.less) file is the *stylesheet* that is  used globally by the VSCode's [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/) extension when rendering Markdown documents. This makes it particular in two ways:

- It is itself a *hardlink* pointing to the [`~/.mume/style.less`](~/.mume/style.less) file, which is the one that is actually used by the extension.

- It is linked to from several distinct locations in the project's [`resources` environment](../../.gitkeep) and plays different roles depending on the context in which it is used.

The table below summarizes the file's name and location, role and context of use of each copy of the  [`~/.mume/style.less`](~/.mume/style.less) stylesheet to be found in the project's [`resources` environment](../../../.gitkeep).

Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Location | Role | Context |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
md-preview.less  | `assets/css/`  | *User's&nbsp;Asset* | The stylesheet as one of the assets available in the user's personal assets' library for use, or not, in the project. |
 base-styles.less | `templates/html-md-ss/`<br/>`<tmplname>/assets/css`  | *Dependency* | A Stylesheet that is imported as a styling asset by other `Html / Markdown` templates. |
 md-preview.less |  `templates/html-md-ss/`  | *LESS&nbsp;Template* | A Stylesheet template to be used as is. Typically the one to copy to [~/.mume/](~/.mume/) when installing the project in an environment that does not contain the original file. |

## Overview

This folder contains templated copies of the main **`Open Source Licenses`**. The files that need to be updated with the project's specific information before being included in a distribution indicate the required replacements by placeholders in the form of all-capitals words surrounded by a pair of double `@` symbols, like`@@PLACEHOLDER@@`.

    Note that the present template stores the licenses in separate `.zip` archives that need to be expanded and linked to from the  [open-source licenses folder](../../open-source-licenses) located at the root of the project's [`resources` environment](../../.gitkeep) upon installation. ***More information aout the handling of external resources can be found in the [external resources folder's `.gitkeep` file](../../xternal-resources/.gitkeep).***

!!!Abstract
    *This folder holds the **`external`** resources, which are files and documents that are maintained
    externally. Its contents are typically linked to from other subfolders of the `resources`
    environment based on their type and purpose.*

## Overview

This folder is intended to group in a single location all the *external resources*, which are the files
and documents that are maintained externally.  The main motivations for doing so instead of
keeping them in the subfolders of the `resources` environment they would belong to based on their
type and purpose are the following:

- This makes the external resourcees quickly identifiable.

- This allows to keep to keep the vendor-specific materials up-to-date more efficiently.

- This allows to exclude them  from operations such as linting or testing with minimal effort.

This approach, however, has one major drawback which is that it makes these resources harder
to find.  To mitigate this issue, the present folder mimics the structure of the `resources`
environment.  This way:

- Tthe external resources can be found in the same location where they would be if merged with the
internal ones.

- Its contents can be easily linked to from the other folders of the environment using
  [folder junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_junction_point),
  [symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) and/or
  [hard links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link).

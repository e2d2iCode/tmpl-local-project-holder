!!!Abstract
    *This folder hosts the user's **`images assets`**, which can be assets per se or any other file that
    can be used to generate such assets. They consist of the non ui-related graphical elements to be
    embedded in the project and that need neither a specific plugin to be diplayed nor further
    processing at build time. Typical examples include  `pictures`, `diagrams`, `charts`, `maps` and,of
    course, images of any type, including animated [`GIFs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF). It is
    worth mentioning that [`PDFs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) that are not strictly reserved to
    be downloaded.*

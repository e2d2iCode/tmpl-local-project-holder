# Executable Assets

!!!abstract
    This folder hosts the user's **`executables`**, which can be assets per se or any other file that can be used to generate such assets. Typical executable assets are **`scripts`** that get included in the project at build time. Note that, unlike **`libraries`** which consist of classes and functions meant to be called by other programs, **`executables`** are meant to be code fragments that accomplish a specific task just by being imported/included in some other file.

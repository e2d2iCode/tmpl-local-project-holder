!!!Abstract
    <i>This folder hosts all assets that relate to the <b><code>user interface</code></b>, which
    can be described as all the graphical elements that display in the projects without needing any
    specific plugin, that require no further processing at build-time, and that functional elements rather
    than illustrations of the project's contents. Typical examples of such assets include
    <code>icons</code>, <code>buttons</code>, <code>logos</code>, <code>profile pics</code>,
    <code>wallpapers</code>, etc...<br/>
    This folder comes with two default sets of ui-assets, namely the full collection of
    <code>octicons</code> in <code>.svg</code> format, and the <code>e2d2ipi</code> logo in
    varous colors and shapes. These assets are to be found in folders named accordingly.

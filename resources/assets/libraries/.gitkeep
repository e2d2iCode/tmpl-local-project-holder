# Libraries Assets

!!!abstract
    This folder hosts the user's **`libraries`** assets, which can be assets per se or any other file that can be used to generate such assets. Libraries typically consist of collections of classe or functions meant to be invoked by other programs. Typical examples include `frameworks`,  `packages` and, of course, `libraries`.

    *This folder hosts the user's **`libraries`** assets, which can be assets per se or any other file that
    can be used to generate such assets. Libraries typically consist of collections of classe or
    functions meant to be invoked by other programs. Typical examples include `frameworks`,
    `packages` and, of course, `libraries`.*

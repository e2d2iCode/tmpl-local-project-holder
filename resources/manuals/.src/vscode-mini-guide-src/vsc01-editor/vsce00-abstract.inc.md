!!!Abstract
     *This documentation provides a quick reference to the
     core features of [Visual Studio Code's Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It focusses on
     aspects that are expected to be used in the context of the prensent template. Reading these
     pages is not a prerequisite to use the template. However, as it points out the way the template
     was designed in the aim of exploiting certain of VSCode's features and extensions, a quick walk
     through before starting to use the template for the first time should be of interest even to those
     who are already familiar with VSCode and is recommended to everyone.*

    This documentation provides a quick reference to the core features of [Visual Studio Code's Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It focusses on aspects that are expected to be used in the context of the prensent template. Reading these pages is not a prerequisite to use the template. However, as it points out the way the template was designed in the aim of exploiting certain of VSCode's features and extensions, a quick walk through before starting to use the template for the first time should be of interest even to those who are already familiar with VSCode and is recommended to everyone.

!!!Abstract
    <i>This folder contains the <b><code>assets</code></b> of the project at hand, which
    are ready-to-use files to be embedded in the project's deliverables at build time. They
    are typically binary files, such as images, audio, or video files, but they can also be
    text files, such as configuration files, or even executable files, such as scripts or
    libraries, as long as the building process includes them as they are.</i>

## Overview

below shows the assets folder's structure and briefly describes each subfolder's content.
For more details on each type of asset, please refer to the `.gitkeep` file of the
corresponding subfolder.

## What's an Asset?

Generally speaking, an asset is any file that is not a source code file but is part of the project. Assets
are typically binary files, such as images, audio, or video files. Still, they can also be text files, such
as configuration files, or even executable files, such as scripts or libraries, as long as the building
process includes them as they are.

In the context of the present folder, however, the term `asset` needs to be interpreted in a broader
way. Here, we let the term `asset` refer to any file that may play the role of an asset in the project's
development or that may serve to generate one.

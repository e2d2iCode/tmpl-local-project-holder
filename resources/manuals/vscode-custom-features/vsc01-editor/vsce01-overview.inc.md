*VSCode_ can be configured at three different levels, namely `User`, `Workspace`, and `Folder`,
which override each other in that order. The `workspace` concept is central to*VSCode*. The way it
has to be configured, in particular, greatly depends on whether it hosts a `single-root` or a
`multi-root` workspace which, as their names suggest, are `workspaces` containing one or multiple
(root) folders, respectively.

Not surprisingly,  `multi-root workspaces`, which this project is a case of, are more complex to
configure than `single-root` ones. This fact justifies providing a quick reference to the `workspace`
concept before going into the details of the specific configuration used in this project.

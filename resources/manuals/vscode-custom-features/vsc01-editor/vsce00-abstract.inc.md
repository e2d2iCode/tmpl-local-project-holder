!!!Abstract
     <i> This documentation provides a quick reference to the <code>Visual Studio Code's
      Editor</code> core features and extensions. It focusses on aspects that are - or, at lease, are
      expected to be used in the context of the prensent template. Reading these pages is not a
      prerequisite to use the template. However, as it points out the way the template was designed in
      the aim of exploiting certain of VSCode's features, walking through it before starting to use the
      template for the first time is recommended to everyone, even to those who are already familiar
      with VSCode. The sections dedicated to the extensions, in particular, should be of interest even
      to VSCode's experts. Not even mentionning the fact that knowledgeable feedbacks and
      suggestions are for sure one of the most valuable assets any project can benefit from.

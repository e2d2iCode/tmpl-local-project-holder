# LaTeX Templates

!!!Abstract
    This folder holds templates to be used in the context of **`LaTeX`** projects. The provided models aim not only to match the needs of  `.tex`, `.sty` and `.cls` files, but to cover the different types of files, based on the role they play.

<!-- ROADMAP The files in this folder are only placeholders that still need to be implemented. This will be done only when needed [DEV] -->

## Overview

This directory contains the user's templates, which are files and folders templates, snippets, and
every document serving as a basis for creating new files, folders, modules, classes, etc.

Note that the `.gitkeep` files to be found in the templates, if any, contain a generic description of the
purpose of the corresponding folder in the context in which it is meant to be used. While designed to
addapt to most situations, these descriptions may need to be updated on a per-project basis in order
to correctly reflect the actual purpose of the folder in the context of the project at hand.

In order to keep the' `.gitkeep` files clean from any comment on the changes mentioned above and
on how the templates should be used, theses informations are provided in the present document
which therefore needs to be updated every time a template is added, removed, or modified.

## Directories: assets folder

The `assets` folder is a template folder that contains a generic folder hierarchy for holding assets. It
was designed to be adapted to a wide range of projects without having to add any folder to its root.
The motivation behind it is to unify the assets folder's structure across projects in order to make it
easier to navigate through them and to facilitate the sharing between projects, as much at the level
of the assets themselves as at the level of the tools used to manage them.

While extending the root level wirh additional folders or renaming the existing ones is strongly
discouraged, removing folders that are not needed in order to narrow down its structure to the
project's needs is perfectly fine. Having to do so is actually expected to be the norm rather than the
exception, and is recommended even if this then requires to update the tree's description in the
root-level `.gitkeep` file. Provided, of course, that you're using it, VSCode's
[Todo-Tree extension](/resources/manuals/vscode-custom-features/vsc03-todo-tree/vsce-todo-tree.doc.md)
should warn you about something needing an `EDIT` to be needed whenever the `assets` folder is
copied outside of the present `templates` folder.

As a final note, let's point our the `resources/assets`, which is built on the same model as this one, is
not a template folder and should not be used as such. It is meant to hold default assets polentially
useful to any project and the `.gitkeep` files that it contains are not suitable for describing the role of
assets' folders in another context. The shortcut consisting in copying both the content and the
container at the same time from the `resources` folder should therefore be avoided even if it is
tempting to do so.

## Open Source Licenses

This folder contains templates of open source `LICENSES` in plain text. The needed replacements
are indicated by placeholders as all-capitals words surrounded by a pair of double `@` symbols,
like`@@PLACEHOLDER@@`. For detailed information about open source licenses including how
to choose one, or for additional [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) website.

## Readme files

This folder contains templates of `README` files in makdown format. Different templates match
different use cases are provided. Placeholders as all-capitals words surrounded by a pair of double
`@` symbols, like `@@PLACEHOLDER@@`, are used to indicate where the user should edit the
template in order to match the project's context. In addition, a comment designed to be detected by
VSCode's Todo-Tree extension as an `EDIT` entry is placed at the end of the file, in order to remind
the user to edit the template.

## Repositories' Seeding Files

This folder contains templates for the files commonly found in `repositories`, namely
`SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
The needed replacements, if any, are indicated by placeholders as all-capitals words surrounded by
a pair of double `@` symbols, like`@@PLACEHOLDER@@`.

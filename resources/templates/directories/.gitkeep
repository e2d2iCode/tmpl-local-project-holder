!!!Abstract
    <i>This folder contains templates consisting in <b><code>folder hierarchies</code></b> like
    the <code>assets</code> folder. The included `.gitkeep` files were redacted such as being as
    generic as possible, but still typically need to be sligthly modified in order to match the project's
    context. If so and VSCode's Todo-Tree extension is used, the latter should display an entry about
    the needed <code>EDIT</code>.</i>

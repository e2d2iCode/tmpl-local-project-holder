# Folder Hirarchies Templates

!!!Abstract
    *This folder contains templates consisting in `folder hierarchies` like the `assets` folder. The included `.gitkeep` files were redacted such as being as generic as possible, but still typically need to be sligthly modified in order to match the project's context. If so and VSCode's Todo-Tree extension is used, the latter should display an entry about the needed `EDIT`.

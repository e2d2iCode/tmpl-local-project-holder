# Downloadable Assets

!!!Abstract
    This folder hosts the assets that are not meant to be displayed, but rather to be  `downloaded`. Typical examples of such documents are `ZIPs`, `DOCs`, `XLS`, etc... Formats like `PDFs` that the project doesn't display, but only provides as a link to download, should also be placed here.

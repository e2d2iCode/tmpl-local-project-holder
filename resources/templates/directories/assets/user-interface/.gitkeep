# User-Interface (UI) Assets

!!!Abstract
    This folder hosts all assets that relate to the **`user interface`**, which can be described as all the graphical elements that display in the projects without needing any specific plugin, that require no further processing at build-time, and that functional elements rather than illustrations of the project's contents. Typical examples of such assets include `icons`, `buttons`, `logos`, `profile pics`, `wallpapers`, etc...<br/>This folder contains two default sets of ui-assets, namely the full collection of `octicons` in `.svg` format, and the `e2d2ipi` logo in varous colors and shapes. These assets are to be found in folders named accordingly.

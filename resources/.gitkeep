!!!Abstract
    <i>This folder hosts the  user's personal <b><code>resources</code></b>. Its
    content is not necessarily strictly tight to the project at hand, but rather consists of a
    collection of potentially useful tools selected by the user based on the project's
    context. As such, part of it may be shared with - or copied from - other projects.

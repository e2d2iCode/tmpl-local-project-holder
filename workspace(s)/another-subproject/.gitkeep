# A Subproject of the Project at Hand

!!!Abstract
    <i>This folder hosts a <b><code>subproject</code></b> of the project at hand. The subproject
     itself may or may not be versioned. If it is, then it typically consists of a
     [GitHub Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Otherwise, it is a
     simple folder containing the subproject's sourcefiles at its root. In both cases, though, the
     <code>workspaces</code> folder should have been renamed to <code>workspace</code>.
     <br/>
      Note that such a folder exists only if the project at hand consists of multiple subprojects. If it
      does not, the name of the <code>workspaces</code> folder should have been left unchanged
      and its sourcefiles - or repo structure - should have been placed directly at its root.

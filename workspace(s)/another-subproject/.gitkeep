# Another Subproject of the Project at Hand

!!!abstract
    This folder hosts a **`subproject`** of the project at hand. The subproject itself may or may not be versioned. If it is, then it typically consists of a [GitHub Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Otherwise, it is a simple folder containing the subproject's sourcefiles at its root. In both cases, though, the `workspaces` folder should have been renamed to `workspace`. <br/>Note that such a folder exists only if the project at hand consists of multiple subprojects. If it does not, the name of the `workspaces` folder should have been left unchanged and its sourcefiles - or repo structure - should have been placed directly at its root.

<!-- EDIT This folder is a placeholder to be replaced by the project's files or a subproject folder [INSTALL] -->

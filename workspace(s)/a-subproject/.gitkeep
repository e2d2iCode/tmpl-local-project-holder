!!!Abstract
    This folder hosts a **`subproject`** of the project at hand. The subproject itself may or may not be
    versioned. If it is, then it typically consists of a
    [GitHub Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Otherwise, it is a
    simple folder containing the subproject's sourcefiles at its root. In both cases, though, the
    `workspaces` folder should have been renamed to `workspace`.
    <br/>
     Note that such a folder exists only if the project at hand consists of multiple subprojects. If it does
     not, the name of the `workspaces` folder should have been left unchanged and its sourcefiles - or
     repo structure - should have been placed directly at its root.

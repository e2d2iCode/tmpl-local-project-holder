     project's nature,it may hosts either a set of source files, a repository and/or a collection of
     subfolders containing subprojects. Note that in the case where this folder contains a single
     project, then it should be renamed in its singular form, which is <code>workspace<br/> instead of
     <code>workpaces</code>.&nbsp;</i>

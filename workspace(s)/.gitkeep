# Working Environment

!!!abstract
    This folder hosts the project's **`working environment`**. Depending on the project's nature,it may hosts either a set of source files, a repository and/or a collection of subfolders containing subprojects. Note that in the case where this folder contains a single project, then it should be renamed in its singular form, which is `workspace` instead of `workpaces`.

<!-- ROADMAP Implement specific templates  for various types of subprojects and embed them here as GitHub Submodules [DEV] -->

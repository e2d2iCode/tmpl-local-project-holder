# Target Specific Deployment Environment

!!!abstract
    This folder is a  **`Dedicated Deployement Environment`**. It contains all the information and tools that are needed to deploy the project to a given `target` at a given `location`.

## Overview

This folder provides a *Target Specif Deployement Environment* that is dedicated to a given *type* of deployment at a given *location*. Its purpose is to extend the common stored at the root of the `deploy` folder with all the specifics of the deployment target at hand. As such, and to the exception of the *target foladers* that it obviously won't contain, its internal structure is the same as that of the `deploy` folder's root. In particular, it contains its own `.sources` folder which purpose is to hold a, possibly customized, copy of the `deploy` folder's `.sources` folder. In order to simplify the deployment procedure, this folder may also contain a *junction*[^1] named `targ-env$$$`[^2] pointing to the folder in the targetted deployment environment that the project must be deployed to. As a good practice, this folder's structure should be preserved even in the case when the common utilities of `deploy`'s root need not be extended. The motivation for doing so is to keep a certain symetry between the different *deployment targets* and to make it easier to add a new *target folder* in the future. As a final note, let mention the [ln.exe](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html) *PowerShell* extension which very efficiently handle *hard* and *soft* links on Windows. The `ln` command it provides happens to be much more versatile than the nativee `mklink` command since, besides its ability to create all sorts of links, it also allows to copy and move folders without breaking the links they contain. Furthermore, its power can be brought to the context menu of the Windows Explorer by installing the [Link Shell Extension](https://tinyurl.com/5n7md3yc) . [^1]: *Junctions* are the Windows equivalent of *symbolic links* on Unix-like systems - i.e. links to folders *or mount points* that are transparent to the user and the applications -, except that they cannot reference files and that they can be created onlx on NTFS partitions. [^2]: The `$$$` suffix indicates that the folder mocks a *Junction* or a *Symlink*. Such a folder is meant to be replaced by an actual virtual folder named the same but with  `.lnk` extension in place of the `$$$` suffix.

# Deployments' Scripts and Commands

!!!abstract
    This folder hosts the deployments' **`commands`** As they mostly consist of scripts that call the specialized ones found in the target environments' folders, they are agnostic of the target environment and shouldn't need much, if any, modification from one project to the next as long as the development environment is the same.
